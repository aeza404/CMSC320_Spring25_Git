Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: We might consider using Git because it allows 
developers to collaborate on projects while on their 
local machines and still upload changes to a shared 
repository. This is important especially if there are 
changes that are being added or changed on a project 
and allows for isolated testing before pushing specific 
features into production. Git also tracks changes in 
the repository and can be helpful when making changes 
on a project. Additionally, git allows developers to 
also see the work of other developers on the project 
and provide feedback on their commits before merging. 
Specifically for this class git will allow us to upload 
our projects and collaborate with other teammates.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science can be applied to the medical field and 
specifically fields related to epidemiology. Since epidemiology 
focuses on studying the spread of diseases and determining factors 
for diseases, data science can help with analyzing that data and 
creating datasets and visualizations that track specific diseases. 
Additionally, data science can serve as a tool for predicting trends 
with certain diseases, illnesses, and outbreaks based on past trends 
in certain regions.
