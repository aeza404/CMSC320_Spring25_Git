Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: We might consider using Git because it allows 
developers to collaborate on projects while on their 
local machines and still upload changes to a shared 
repository. This is important especially if there are 
changes that are being added or changed on a project 
and allows for isolated testing before pushing specific 
features into production. Git also tracks changes in 
the repository and can be helpful when making changes 
on a project. Additionally, git allows developers to 
also see the work of other developers on the project 
and provide feedback on their commits before merging. 
Specifically for this class git will allow us to upload 
our projects and collaborate with other teammates.
