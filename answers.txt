Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science can be applied to the medical field and 
specifically fields related to epidemiology. Since epidemiology 
focuses on studying the spread of diseases and determining factors 
for diseases, data science can help with analyzing that data and 
creating datasets and visualizations that track specific diseases. 
Additionally, data science can serve as a tool for predicting trends 
with certain diseases, illnesses, and outbreaks based on past trends 
in certain regions.
